# Code and Coffee

Tech tutorials often represent a "perfect" environment where errors don't happen. What about when errors do happen? How do I/you learn new things? What's the experience like?

That's what I want to document. This is an informal way to learn about code related stuff.

I used to go to events called "Cars and Coffee" where you would just shoot the shit with other people interested in cars, talk about things related to them, and work through ideas. You may not get a solution every time but you could get new ideas.

This is my code version of that. It's raw, unfiltered, and will probably be filled with a lot of "umms", "what", and "why did I choose this one to try..."

## How it works

I get a lot of questions via email - often I'm answering the same questions multiple times. I love answering them but sometimes, especially when I'm answering a question for the fifth time, I don't give great/detailed answers - I rush through it. I want to improve on that and have a place to point people to when they have a question.

These answers (typically in video) won't be formal or polished. They'll just be me trying to learn something or work through an issue. This is valuable in that you can see how I (and others) think through a problem - something that's hard to pick up if you don't have a mentor/boss/co-worker debugging alongside you.

## Guidelines

* Check if your question has already been asked
* Keep things clear and focused on the question at hand. You don't have to be great with English but give it your best shot
* Ask one question per issue
* Follow the issue template (if you don't I'll close the issue)
* I typically work with React Native but anything JavaScript, Meteor, Express, React, etc. etc. is fair game
