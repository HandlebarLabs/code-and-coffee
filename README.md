# Code and Coffee

I get a lot of questions via email - often I'm answering the same questions multiple times. I love answering them but sometimes, especially when I'm answering a question for the fifth time, I don't give great/detailed answers - I rush through it. I want to improve on that and have a place to point people to when they have a question.

These answers (typically in video) won't be formal or polished. They'll just be me trying to learn something or work through an issue. This is valuable in that you can see how I (and others) think through a problem - something that's hard to pick up if you don't have a mentor/boss/co-worker debugging alongside you.

## Guidelines

- Check if your question has already been asked
- Keep things clear and focused on the question at hand. You don't have to be great with English but give it your best shot
- Ask one question per issue
- Follow the issue template (if you don't I'll close the issue)
- I typically work with React Native but anything JavaScript, Meteor, Express, React, etc. etc. is fair game
